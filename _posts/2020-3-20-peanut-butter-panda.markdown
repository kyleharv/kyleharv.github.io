Once upon a time<br>
Way up north in Maine,<br>
A fluffy, puffy panda<br>
Was born in pouring rain.<br>
His name came from the yummy treat<br>
His mom and dad loved so.<br>
Peanut Butter was the name<br>
Their son would learn to know.<br>
Peanut Butter was allergic<br>
To peanuts and could not eat<br>
The snack that he was named for:<br>
His parentsâ€™ favorite treat.<br>
Peanut Butter Panda lives<br>
In Pookaberry Zoo,<br>
And on the pebbly coast of Maine<br>
His great adventures grew.<br>
