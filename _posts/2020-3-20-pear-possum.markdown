In Pookaberry Zoo<br>
On the rocky coast of Maine,<br>
A little baby possum<br>
Was born on Possum Lane.<br>
Theyâ€™re called Virginia possums<br>
In Canada and US.<br>
His name was Pear<br>
From Asian pears<br>
His Mama loved the best.<br>
Pear Possum loves his family<br>
And loves adventure too.<br>
He loves always exploring<br>
In Pookaberry Zoo.<br>
