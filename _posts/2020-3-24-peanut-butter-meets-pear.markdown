The boats were in the harbor<br>
Rocking in the wind.<br>
Peanut Butter strolled along<br>
Just looking for a friend.<br>
The Panda loved the cool crisp air<br>
And puffy clouds of white.<br>
He sat down on a metal bench<br>
And watched the gulls take flight.<br>
He sat and sat until the sun<br>
Dropped from out of sight.<br>
He didn’t know that this would be<br>
A very special night.<br>
Along the dock came walking<br>
A wonderful sight to see.<br>
Peanut Butter saw a possum.<br>
He said, “A friend for me.”<br>
