The eight mile island Monomoy,<br>
A wildlife refuge home,<br>
Was home to Molly Eagle,<br>
A bird who loved to roam.<br>
She set out on adventures<br>
To see the Northern Lights.<br>
She often became lonely<br>
On all her lengthy flights.<br>
She daydreamed of companions,<br>
Friends who like to fly<br>
To Canada and back again<br>
Racing through the sky.<br>
On one late autumn evening,<br>
Somewhere near Johnson Bay,<br>
She found two very perfect friends<br>
To help her on her way.
