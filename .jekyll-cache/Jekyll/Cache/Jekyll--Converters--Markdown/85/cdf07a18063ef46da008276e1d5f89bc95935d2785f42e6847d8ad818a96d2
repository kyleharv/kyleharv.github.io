I"Ò<p>The boats were in the harbor<br />
Rocking in the wind
Peanut Butter strolled along
Just looking for a friend
The Panda loved the cool crisp air
And puffy clouds of white
He sat down on a metal bench
And watched the gulls take flight.
He sat and sat until the sun
Dropped from out of sight
He didnâ€™t know that this would be
A very special night
Along the dock came walking
A wonderful sight to see
Peanut Butter saw a possum
He said, â€œA friend for me.â€</p>
