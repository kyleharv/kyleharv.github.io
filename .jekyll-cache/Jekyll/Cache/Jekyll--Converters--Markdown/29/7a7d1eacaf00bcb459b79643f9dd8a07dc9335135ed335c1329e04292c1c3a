I"<p>The eight mile island Monomoy,<br />
A wildlife refuge home,<br />
Was home to Molly Eagle,<br />
A bird who loved to roam.<br />
She set out on adventures<br />
To see the Northern Lights.<br />
She often became lonely<br />
On all her lengthy flights.<br />
She daydreamed of companions,<br />
Friends who like to fly<br />
To Canada and back again<br />
Racing through the sky.<br />
On one late autumn evening,<br />
Somewhere near Johnson Bay,<br />
She found two very perfect friends<br />
To help her on her way.<br /></p>
