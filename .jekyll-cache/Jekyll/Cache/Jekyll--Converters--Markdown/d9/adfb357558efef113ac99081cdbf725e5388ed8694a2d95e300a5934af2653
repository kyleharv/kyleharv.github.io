I"0<p>The boats were in the harbor<br />
Rocking in the wind.<br />
Peanut Butter strolled along<br />
Just looking for a friend.<br />
The Panda loved the cool crisp air<br />
And puffy clouds of white.<br />
He sat down on a metal bench<br />
And watched the gulls take flight.<br />
He sat and sat until the sun<br />
Dropped from out of sight.<br />
He didn’t know that this would be<br />
A very special night<br />
Along the dock came walking<br />
A wonderful sight to see<br />
Peanut Butter saw a possum<br />
He said, “A friend for me.”<br /></p>
