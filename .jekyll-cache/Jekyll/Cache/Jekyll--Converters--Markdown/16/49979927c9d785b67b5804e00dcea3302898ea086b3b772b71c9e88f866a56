I"t<p>Peanut Butter Panda plays in Pookaberry Zoo.<br />
And on the pebbly coast of Maine<br />
Pear Possum plays there too.<br />
Pitter patter paw prints<br />
Decorate the sand.<br />
The plucky pair of best friends<br />
Dance across the land.<br />
In search of great adventure,<br />
Their travels take them far.<br />
Pear and Peanut Butter<br />
Catch the nearest star.<br />
Past purple mountains,<br />
Deep blue seas,<br />
Through Northern lights<br />
They ride with ease.<br />
Walking, riding, dancing, flying<br />
On rocks and sandy shore,<br />
The possum and the panda<br />
Make friends forever more.<br /></p>
