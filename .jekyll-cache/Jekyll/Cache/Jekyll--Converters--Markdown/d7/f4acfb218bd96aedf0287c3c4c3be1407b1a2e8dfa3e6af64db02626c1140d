I"<p>Once upon a time<br />
Way up north in Maine,<br />
A fluffy, puffy panda<br />
Was born in pouring rain.<br />
His name came from the yummy treat<br />
His mom and dad loved so.<br />
Peanut Butter was the name<br />
Their son would learn to know.<br />
Peanut Butter is allergic<br />
To peanuts and can not eat<br />
The snack that he was named for:<br />
His parentsâ€™ favorite treat.<br />
Peanut Butter Panda lives<br />
In Pookaberry Zoo,<br />
And on the pebbly coast of Maine<br />
His great adventures grew.<br /></p>
