I"<p>Peanut Butter Panda plays in Pookaberry Zoo.
And on the pebbly coast of Maine
Pear Possum plays there too.
Pitter patter paw prints
Decorate the sand.
The plucky pair of best friends
Dance across the land.
In search of great adventure,
Their travels take them far.
Pear and Peanut Butter
Catch the nearest star.
Past purple mountains,
Deep blue seas,
Through Northern lights
They ride with ease.
Walking, riding, dancing, flying
On rocks and sandy shore,
The possum and the panda
Make friends forever more.</p>
