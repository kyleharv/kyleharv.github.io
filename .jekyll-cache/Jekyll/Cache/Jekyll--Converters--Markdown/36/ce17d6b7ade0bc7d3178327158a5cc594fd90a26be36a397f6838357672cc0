I"<p>The boats were in the harbor<br />
Rocking in the wind<br />
Peanut Butter strolled along<br />
Just looking for a friend 
The Panda loved the cool crisp air<br />
And puffy clouds of white<br />
He sat down on a metal bench<br />
And watched the gulls take flight.<br />
He sat and sat until the sun 
Dropped from out of sight<br />
He didn’t know that this would be<br />
A very special night<br />
Along the dock came walking<br />
A wonderful sight to see<br />
Peanut Butter saw a possum  
He said, “A friend for me.”</p>
