I"·<p>Once upon a time
Way up north in Maine,
A fluffy, puffy panda
Was born in pouring rain.
His name came from the yummy treat
His mom and dad loved so.
Peanut Butter was the name
Their son would learn to know.
Peanut Butter was allergic
To peanuts and could not eat
The snack that he was named for:
His parentsâ€™ favorite treat.
Peanut Butter Panda lives
In Pookaberry Zoo,
And on the pebbly coast of Maine
His great adventures grew.</p>
